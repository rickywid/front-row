# Front Row with React

## Overview
Front Row is a place where you can find tickets to different events. Ticket data including prices, availability, venue locations and performers were pulled from [SeatGeek's API](http://platform.seatgeek.com/). The user can search for tickets according performer, venue or city location. Front Row uses geo location to find events happening around the user's location.
